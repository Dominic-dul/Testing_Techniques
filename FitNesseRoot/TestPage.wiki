This is a test page for the Auction system placeBid method acceptance tests.
For this method, there are two possible outcomes: whether the bid placement is successful or not.
The bid placement successfulness depends on these four factors:

1. If an auction exists, then the bid is allowed to be placed
        -To place a bid on an existing auction, you have to provide an existing auction ID;

| test.PlaceBidFitnesseTest |
| newBid | startPrice | auctionId | invalidAuctionTest? |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | 0 | true |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | 156 | false |

2. If an auction is opened (current time > auction start time) then the bid is allowed to be placed
        -auctionStartedBefore filed describes when did the auction start (in milliseconds)

| test.PlaceBidFitnesseTest |
| newBid | startPrice | auctionStartedBefore | notOpenedAuctionTest? |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | 1000 | true |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | -1 | false |

3. If the auction has not ended yet, the bid is allowed to be placed;
        -auctionDuration is at what time does the auction end. It should be provided in milliseconds

| test.PlaceBidFitnesseTest |
| newBid | startPrice | auctionDuration | auctionExpiredTest? |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | 10000 | true |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | -1 | false |

4. If the new bid is higher than the old bid, the bid is allowed to be placed

| test.PlaceBidFitnesseTest |
| newBid | startPrice | checkPriceValidityTest? |
| 15.0 | 10.0 | true |
| 15.0 | 16.0 | false |
